# Twitter Earthquake Detection

Tool to detect earthquakes by scanning Twitter based on the paper ["Earthquake shakes Twitter users: real-time event detection by social sensors" by Sakaki, Okazaki, Matsuo](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1772690.1772777).

We developed the tool to acquire data and the code to train a machine learning model to detect tweets talking about earthquakes. Finally we developed a tool that uses the retrieved tweets to estimate the likelihood of a seismic event and its position.
